'''
Create an inventory tracking system that has all of the following features:

    Each item will have a name, quantity, and description as a dictionary.

    All dictionaries will be saved in a master inventory list.

    A function that adds something to that list (creates the dictionary and adds to the list).

    A function that displays the inventory in a readable format (i.e. do not just print out the list or dictionary, separate them out).

    A function that will change the quantity of an item (this is difficult to do and many ways to do it).

    A function that removes an item from the list.
