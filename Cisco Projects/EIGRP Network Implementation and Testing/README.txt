EIGRP Network Implementation and Testing

#### Summary:
In this lab, I implemented and tested an EIGRP-enabled network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consisted of multiple subnets, routers, and hosts with specific IP addressing requirements. Configuration involved assigning IP addresses to interfaces, setting up clock rates on DCE interfaces, and enabling EIGRP routing with AS number 5205. Key steps included:

1. **Network Configuration**:
   - Connected devices with appropriate cables, including crossover cables for Ethernet links.
   - Configured device hostnames, interface IP addresses, and clock rates on serial interfaces.
   - Verified connectivity through pings and ensured all directly connected networks were present in routing tables.

2. **EIGRP Setup**:
   - Enabled EIGRP on all routers and applied the necessary network statements.
   - Configured passive interfaces and disabled automatic summarization.
   - Verified EIGRP functionality, including neighbor adjacencies and protocol settings.

3. **Bandwidth and Delay Adjustments**:
   - Configured bandwidth values on serial interfaces to match clock rates.
   - Adjusted delay values on specific interfaces to modify EIGRP metrics.
   - Verified configurations using interface status commands.

The lab concluded with completing analysis questions and submitting the configured Packet Tracer file alongside the answer document. This exercise reinforced my understanding of EIGRP routing, network configuration, and protocol optimization in a simulated environment.
