GRE Tunnel Configuration

In this lab, I will be setting up a GRE tunnel between two sites, Site A (RA) and Site B (RB), to allow inter-site connectivity. The network configuration includes two subnets: 172.31.0.0/24 for Site A and 172.31.1.0/24 for Site B. Each site has its own router (RA and RB), with additional devices (PCA and PCB) connected to the routers. A GRE tunnel is required between RA and RB to facilitate communication, as private IP addresses cannot be forwarded by the Internet. I will need to identify and correct any configuration errors preventing PCA from pinging PCB, set the hostnames of the routers, and ensure static routes are properly configured on both RA and RB. After making the necessary corrections, I will test the GRE tunnel and ensure connectivity between PCA and PCB using ping and traceroute commands.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Set Up GRE Tunnel**: You will configure a GRE tunnel between routers RA and RB. This involves setting up Tunnel interfaces with specific IP addresses and ensuring that the tunnel correctly encapsulates traffic between the two routers.

2. **Configure Static Routes**: You will configure static routes on both routers to ensure proper routing of IP packets either through the GRE tunnel or to the Internet. These static routes direct traffic from PCA to PCB and vice versa.

3. **Correct Configuration Errors**: The network configuration contains errors that prevent PCA from pinging PCB. Your task will be to identify and correct these errors in the configuration, including adjusting interface settings, routing tables, and tunnel configurations.

4. **Test Connectivity**: After fixing the configuration errors, you will test the GRE tunnel by performing ping and traceroute operations between PCA and PCB. The successful completion of these tests will confirm that the tunnel is working correctly and that the network is fully functional.

This lab helps to reinforce the concepts of tunneling and static routing while also improving troubleshooting skills related to GRE tunnels and network configurations.
